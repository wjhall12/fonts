And we are going look at Roboto, Regular 400, Sacramento, and Montserrat 400 regular. Copy the link and paste it in the head section of the html. This will enable the user to view the font on any browser because the browser will take them to the location of the link and grab the fonts. So now you can copy and paste the font family where you want to put it in your CSS. So for body we will use Roboto. Then for h1 we will use Sacramento and for h2 and h3 we will use Montserrat.
